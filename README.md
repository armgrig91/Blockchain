# VotingSmartContract

## This simple Voting smart contract.

Deployer creates a list of candidates via constructor by providing the list of strings ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3"] as an argument.

Note that solidity supports string[] array passing via constructor starting from 0.8.7 version.

Remix IDE is used for contract deployment.
